# Student Analysis using unsupervised learning method
This is a real life project based on performance of the students of my college i.e BENGAL COLLEGE OF ENGINEERING AND TECHNOLOGY, Durgapur,
West Bengal in different subjects in 2nd semester 2014.
### Objective of project 
To figure out types(groups) of students studying in that semester on the basis of their performance in different subjects.<br />
#### Workings on Project
1. Data Filteration:-
 Irrelavant features/columns have been droped like Name, Roll no., etc. and since machine learning algorithms work on some sort of
 numerical feature vector(s) so features/columns were filtered/cleaned to make it as required. This is data Cleaning.
 
2. Unsupervised Model(machine learning model) used
  K-means is a partitioning unsupervised machine learning algorithm (clustering algorithm) has been used to draw out hidden pattern form
  the dataset.
 ### OBSERVATION
  After appling the k-means clustering algorithm, it has been observed that there were four distinct group in that batch (keeping
  3 important subjects and their mean score as scales respectively).<br />
  Eventually, those four groups were analysied on the basis of the same scale.
  
  # RESULT <br />
   This project may help college management to understand the study pattern and subject of interests of students so that it(management) can
   come up with some measures to resolve unwanted issues if they found from that batch and can make plan/stategies for
   the upcoming bathes accordingly. In this way management can improve the way of teaching.
   
   ## NOTE:
   MY ONGOING PROJECT IS ON TIME SERIES based.
